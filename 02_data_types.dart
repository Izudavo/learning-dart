// note in dart, all data types are basically objects,
// therefore default values will be "null", unless they are initialized

// variable declaration

int age = 10; // the int already makes the age a number

// alternatively,

var birthdate = 10; // with var, variable is declared
// based on what is on the right


// for variables:

// Numbers are divided into:

// 1. int, 2. double


// String, represented with String

// boolean, represented with bool
